## Project Members & Communication
Sheryl Wang, Luke Morrison, Camden Cobb, Cameron Maricque

In order to communicate with each other, we plan to use our .wisc emails and an Outlook group to communicate asynchronously about project details. 
We also created a github repository with each group member having collaborator access so that we can edit our R Markdown and HTML files seperately;
this means that it is less necessary to schedule physical meet ups which is difficult with everyone's schedules. 

In order to ensure that we maintain high quality code without in-person meetings we can Code Review by: 
 - Each team member reviewing another's code
   - Documentation of reviewing findings
  

## Question of Interest
What is the relationship between passenger age and survival probability on the Titanic, and can we use this relationship to predict survival chances for passengers of different ages? 


## Data
Link to data: https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets/tree/master/Datasets

Description of data:
Data Collection and Source:
   The Titanic dataset was compiled from historical passengers and official records of the RMS Titanic's maiden voyage in 1912. The primary source materials are: 
1. Official passenger manifests 
2. Encyclopedia Titanica 
3. Survival records from the disaster 
4. Ticket purchasing recrods and boarding documents 

Unit Of Observation:
Each Row in the dataset represents one individual passenger aboard the Titanic's maiden voyage. 

Population:
The dataset represents the complete population of all documented passengers aboard the Titanic (not just a sample) 

What are Our Key Variables: 
1. Age: 
Continous numerical variable, measured by passenger's age in years. 
Missing values present: yes 

2. Survived 
Type: Binary categorical variable
Bernoulli: 0 = did not survive 1 = Survived 
No missing values for this 
This is our dependent variable

## Graph/Visualization
Primary Visualization:
We will create a Scatter Plot with our x-axis as age (0-80) and Y axis (0 or 1) We can also create an age distribution subplot to make a histogram fora age distribution with seperate colors for survivors and non-survivors to help enhance visualizing age-related survival patterns. 
We could add vertical reference lines for meaninful age boundaries (18 for children, 65 for seniors) 
In order to make the experiment more complex, we could add a Prediction interval with a light red shade which would show the 95% prediction interval 


## Inference method
Our inference method will be: Linear Regression.
Independent (X): Age (continuous)
Dependent (Y): Survival status (binary: 0/1)

Justification:
1. While our dependent variable is binary, we belive linear regression can still provide meaningful insights about probability of survival.
2. Age being continuous as our predictor makes linear regression appropriate. 
3. The coefficients will give a clear sign as change in survival probability per year of age. 

We will supplement our Linear Regression with a prediction interval at 95%
